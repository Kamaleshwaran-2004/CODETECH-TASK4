       Here's an overview of the Java-based Product Recommendation System using Apache Mahout:

🧠 Overview: Product Recommendation System Using Java & Apache Mahout

📌 Objective:
To create a basic yet functional user-based collaborative filtering system that recommends products or content to users based on past user preferences, leveraging Apache Mahout and Java.

🔧 Tools & Technologies:

Java (Core programming language)

Apache Mahout (Machine Learning library)

Maven (Dependency management)

CSV file (for user-item ratings dataset)

🗂️ Working Principle:

The system reads a CSV dataset containing user IDs, item IDs, and rating scores.

It uses Apache Mahout’s collaborative filtering algorithms to find users with similar preferences.

Recommendations are generated for a target user by analyzing what similar users have liked or rated highly.

👨‍💻 Implementation Steps:

Set up a Maven project with Apache Mahout as a dependency.

Prepare a CSV file with sample user-item-rating data.

Write Java code using Mahout classes like FileDataModel, UserSimilarity, UserNeighborhood, and GenericUserBasedRecommender.

Run the application to generate and display recommended items for a given user.

📈 Output Example:
For user 1, the system might recommend:

Item 103 (score: 4.1)

Item 104 (score: 3.9)

✅ Benefits:

Easy to implement using Mahout’s built-in algorithms.

Flexible: can extend to item-based filtering, real datasets, or web integration.

Scalable: Mahout is designed for large-scale data processing.

🚀 Possible Enhancements:

Switch to item-based recommendation.

Integrate real-time user feedback or a database.

Build a web interface using JavaFX or Spring Boot.
